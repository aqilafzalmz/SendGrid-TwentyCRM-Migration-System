## What Was Fixed

The issue was that the code was trying to send complex field structures to Twenty CRM without those fields being configured in the object metadata.

**Fixed by:**
1. Using minimal payload for companies - just the `name` field
2. Removing complex field structures (domainName, address, etc.) that require metadata configuration
3. Using the correct `/rest/companies` endpoint instead of `/rest/people`

## Check Your Twenty CRM

1. Log into https://calm-lime-giraffe.twenty.com/
2. Go to **Companies** tab
3. You should see **14 companies** with proper names

## What Each Company Has

- **Name**: Company name from SendGrid (or email if no company name)
- No other fields (to avoid metadata errors)

If you want to add more fields (email, phone, address, etc.), you need to configure them in Twenty CRM first.

## Next Steps

If you want to see people instead of companies, change the destination in `logs/selected-lists.json`:

```json
{
  "listIds": ["..."],
  "listNames": ["..."],
  "destinationType": "people"  // Change from "company" to "people"
}
```

Then run: `npm start`
