# Migration Fixed! ✅

## What Was Wrong

1. **Names showing as "Untitled"**: The system was sending `name` as a string, but Twenty CRM expects `name` as an object with `{firstName: "...", lastName: "..."}`
2. **Empty Email/Company fields**: The minimal mode wasn't sending emails or other data
3. **Wrong endpoint for companies**: When migrating to "company" destination, it was using the people endpoint instead of companies endpoint

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Fixed Name Field Structure
**Before:**
```javascript
payload.name = "John Doe" // ❌ Wrong - expects string
```

**After:**
```javascript
payload.name = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
} // ✅ Correct - expects object
```

### 2. Fixed Email Field
Now sends email in the correct Twenty CRM format:
```javascript
payload.emails = {
  primaryEmail: data.email,
  additionalEmails: null
}
```

### 3. Fixed Company vs People Endpoints
**Before:**
- Used people endpoint for everything (even when destination is "company")

**After:**
- Uses `/rest/companies` endpoint when destination is "company"
- Uses `/rest/people` endpoint when destination is "people"

### 4. Added Phone and City Support
Now also sends phone and location data if available:
```javascript
if (data.phone) {
  payload.phones = {
    primaryPhoneNumber: data.phone,
    primaryPhoneCallingCode: '',
    primaryPhoneCountryCode: '',
    additionalPhones: null
  };
}

if (data.location) {
  payload.city = data.location;
}
```

## What Data Will Be Migrated Now

For each contact, the system will send:

| Field | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Name (firstName)** | First name or email username | SendGrid `firstName` or email prefix |
| **Name (lastName)** | Last name | SendGrid `lastName` |
| **Email** | Email address | SendGrid `EMAIL` |
| **Phone** | Phone number | SendGrid `PHONE_NUMBER` (if available) |
| **City** | Location | SendGrid `CITY` (if available) |

## How to Run the Fixed Migration

### Step 1: Delete the "Untitled" entries (optional but recommended)

Since the old migration created "Untitled" entries, you might want to delete them before re-running:

1. Log into https://calm-lime-giraffe.twenty.com/
2. Go to the People tab
3. Select the "Untitled" entries created by "API SendGrid Migrati..."
4. Delete them

### Step 2: Run the migration

```bash
# For People (default)
npm start

# For Companies (if that's what you configured)
npm start
```

The system will now:
1. ✅ Create contacts with proper names (not "Untitled")
2. ✅ Populate the email field
3. ✅ Use the correct endpoint (companies or people)
4. ✅ Include phone and location if available

## Expected Results

### In People Tab:
- Names will show properly (not "Untitled")
- Email column will be populated
- City column will show location (if available)
- Phone column will show phone numbers (if available)

### In Companies Tab:
- Company records will be created (if destination is "company")
- Company name will come from the `company` field in SendGrid
- Email will be populated

## Example of What Will Be Created

**From SendGrid:**
```
EMAIL: john@example.com
FIRST_NAME: John
LAST_NAME: Doe
CITY: New York
PHONE_NUMBER: +1234567890
Organisation: ABC Corp
```

**In Twenty CRM:**
```
First Name: John
Last Name: Doe  
Email: john@example.com
Phone: +1234567890
City: New York
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still see "Untitled" entries:

1. Check the logs: `logs/migration-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
2. Look for any errors during the name extraction
3. Make sure the SendGrid CSV has email addresses

## Next Steps

1. **Run the migration:** `npm start`
2. **Check Twenty CRM:** Verify contacts are showing proper names and emails
3. **Check the logs:** Review any errors in `logs/migration-YYYY-MM-DD.log`

## Need to Configure Custom Fields?

If you want to migrate additional fields (like "Organisation", "Source", "Priority", etc.):

1. See `docs/twenty-crm-setup.md` for instructions
2. Configure the fields in Twenty CRM Settings → Objects
3. The code is ready to send them once configured

The current implementation sends the core fields that work with standard Twenty CRM installations.
