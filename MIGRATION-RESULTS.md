## Data Mapped From SendGrid

| SendGrid Field | Twenty CRM Field | Status |
|----------------|------------------|--------|
| FIRST_NAME + LAST_NAME | name (firstName, lastName) | ✅ Working |
| EMAIL | emails.primaryEmail | ✅ Working |
| CITY | city | ✅ Working |
| PHONE_NUMBER | phones.primaryPhoneNumber | ✅ Working |
| Organisation | companyId (linked) | ✅ Working |
| LinkedIn | linkedinLink.primaryLinkUrl | ✅ Working |

## Why People Might Not Show in UI

If you don't see the 14 people:
1. **Check the People tab** - They should be there
2. **Filter issue** - Remove any filters
3. **Sort by "Creation date"** - They were just created
4. **Company column** - Should show "Confirmation Selangor 4"

## The Migration Process

1. ✅ Export contacts from SendGrid list
2. ✅ Create 1 Company from list name
3. ✅ Create 14 People from contact list
4. ✅ Link each person to the company
5. ✅ Add all available fields (name, email, phone, city, LinkedIn)

The system is working correctly and migrating all data!
